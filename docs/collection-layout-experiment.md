# Collection layout experiment

This manual diagnostic compares inode use, append cost, sequential reads and
compaction through the real Pouch engine. It is excluded from normal builds,
bench gates and releases. It changes no production API or storage format.

Run on the filesystem used by the application:

```sh
make compare-collection-layouts-smoke
make compare-collection-layouts
```

`COLLECTION_LAYOUT_DIR` selects the fixture/log directory, defaulting to
`build/collection-layout`. `COLLECTION_LAYOUT_RUNS` selects an odd sample count
from 1 through 9, default 3. Each sample has its own fresh root and removes that
fixture on completion. Logs and median `summary.tsv` remain in that directory.
The diagnostic currently requires native Linux and `/proc/self/io`.

## Layouts

- `raw`: compact JSONL, one write per complete entry, with a mutex around
  record append when using multiple producers. This is a storage lower bound;
  it has no identity index, lease fencing, retention or payload integrity checks.
- `pull`: the existing public atomic append into shared rolling segments.
- `push`: the public incremental writer, staging encoded payloads with a fixed
  64 KiB heap cap and anonymous spill, then copying into shared rolling segments.
- `buffered`: an experimental producer adapter. It accepts 4096-byte input
  chunks into a heap buffer, growing only up to the configured limit. Crossing
  that limit spills the buffered prefix and subsequent input to a private
  temporary file. Commit supplies the buffered or spooled input to the existing
  atomic pull append. The spool is copied into the canonical log, then removed.

The experimental 64 KiB cap is per active producer. There is no buffer pool,
whole-history cache or chunked canonical publication. Oversized entries incur
an explicit spool write/read pass. The synthetic input buffer is separate from
the adapter's measured staging bound; the benchmark creates that same input
for every layout.
The `adapter_spooled` and `adapter_stage_capacity_bound` counters describe only
the adapter, not the public push writer's internal staging.

This is a producer/layout experiment, **not a replacement public push API**.
The existing atomic append validates JSON and fences publication at commit.
The adapter does not preserve public push admission-time fencing or write-time
validation. The public `push` path preserves both and supports configured
codecs; its spools contain ciphertext on encrypted roots. This diagnostic uses
plaintext, uncompressed roots. The adapter's CLI buffer limit controls only
the adapter; public push uses its fixed 64 KiB encoded staging cap.

## Workloads and accounting

The runner pairs small entries, four-producer durable appends, forced spill,
and a larger read fixture. An indexed profile separately exposes LQL page-file
growth; that profile runs once rather than reporting a paired median. The
experiment deliberately retains the existing order/identity indexes,
publication protocol and group-sync machinery; comparisons against raw JSONL
include those additional SDK responsibilities.

Durable mode waits for an fsync covering each completed entry in every layout.
Raw writers release the append mutex before fsync so concurrent writes may
share a filesystem flush. Pouch retains its real batcher. NoSync mode excludes
the later checkpoint from append timing; checkpoint time and I/O are reported
separately. `per_op_us` is amortized throughput time, not a per-caller latency
percentile when producers run concurrently.

Read timing uses a counting sink. Separate, untimed verification checks every
body byte, unique producer IDs, complete output and monotonic commit positions.
It never accumulates the output. Both pre/post-compaction cold-read attempts
follow close, fsync and per-file `POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED`, then reopen. This is
**advised page-cache eviction**, not proof of physical-media reads; it does not
evict device caches or use global cache-dropping operations. Warm reads follow
immediately. Use the stricter `compare-collection-read` diagnostic when verified
page residency is required.

File inventories count regular files, directories, canonical segments/snapshots,
LQL page files, apparent bytes and allocated blocks. Process I/O counters report
read/write calls and kernel-accounted storage bytes. These are not physical
device IOPS and exclude filesystem journal/metadata traffic not charged there.

## What compaction does today

Forced collection compaction copies retained records into one snapshot, keeping
their stored payload bytes and building matching projections. An active tail
remains for new appends. Old files are reclaimed only after reader protection
and the deletion grace period permit it. The experiment sets that grace to zero
only for its owned fixtures, with no outstanding readers.

Automatic selection currently requires reclaimable deleted payload. A pure
append journal therefore reports no automatic consolidation. Forced compaction
can reduce the inode count, but rewrites the retained history; repeating whole
collection compaction is not evidence of sustainable incremental consolidation.
The probe verifies the data again after forced compaction and reports its
time, I/O, resulting file count and sequential read costs.

Public push buffering/spooling addresses canonical segment growth. LQL pages still
use one artifact per covered group of up to 63 positions. Packed indexing and
lock consolidation are separate changes. This experiment supplies evidence for
a design decision; it does not establish production readiness, huge-history
scalability or journalctl-equivalent performance.

## Direct versus staged pull

```sh
make compare-collection-pull-smoke
COLLECTION_LAYOUT_RUNS=5 make compare-collection-pull
```

`COLLECTION_PULL_DIR` selects the fixture/log directory, defaulting to
`build/collection-pull`. `pull-summary.tsv` contains medians from fresh paired
runs with alternating order. This comparison adds no production configuration,
automatic path selection or second staging implementation.

Both variants consume the same single-pass callback with the same chunk size:

- `direct-pull` passes it to public `lc_collection_append`.
- `staged-pull` passes it to public `lc_collection_append_staged`, which consumes
  the source with a bounded 16 KiB heap input chunk through the existing writer.
  Production validation, callback guards, encoded staging, spill and publication
  handle the entry.

The probe verifies that every input byte was consumed once with the expected
number of source calls, including EOF. It also checks append outcomes, closes
and reopens storage, and verifies every output byte, identity and position.
No compaction runs in this comparison. The synthetic input exists in memory for
both variants; the comparison performs no preparatory whole-value copy.

Profiles cover 1 KiB and 128 KiB entries, one/four producer threads sharing a
collection receiver under shared-root policy, NoSync and selected durable cases.
This does not measure independent-process scheduling. Fast sources use 16 KiB
reads. Controlled slow sources sleep 100 microseconds before each nonempty
256-byte or 4096-byte read. This models waiting on input, not an actual disk or
network transport. Scheduler overhead
can lengthen each sleep; both paths use the identical source routine.

Alongside amortized append time, process CPU and kernel-accounted write bytes,
the summary reports medians of each run's per-entry p50/p95/p99 latency.
Per-entry latency starts immediately before the SDK call and includes source
consumption, validation and commit; input generation is excluded. Amortized
append timing also includes producer startup and input generation. Sample
quantiles are descriptive and have limited tail resolution for small profiles.

For direct invocation, `LOCKDC_LAYOUT_SOURCE_CHUNK` selects 1..16384 bytes and
`LOCKDC_LAYOUT_SOURCE_DELAY_US` selects 0..10000 microseconds, for these two modes.
`LOCKDC_LAYOUT_COMPACT=0` skips compaction while retaining reopen/read checks.
Defaults are 16384, 0 and 1 respectively. The smoke target covers small,
threshold-sized, spilled, delayed and one-byte-fragment sources, with concurrent
and durable cases under sanitizers and allocation tracking.

These measurements compare the public direct and explicitly staged APIs.
Both preserve callback/retry semantics; staged input uses writer admission
separately from publication. Source errors, owner closure, fencing, codecs and
slow/concurrent writers are covered by the collection C and Lua test suites.
